            <p>If you want to search the information on this page, press Ctrl+F on your keyboard. This will bring up a small search box where you can enter in the word or phrase you are looking for. The program will then search through the entire document displaying any instances of the word or phrase you entered. &nbsp;</p>
            
            <p>For example, if you knew your Trade Tariff commodity code was 2835260000, you would press Ctrl + F, enter 2835260000 into the search box, and then press return. This will take you to the relevant row in the table, where you can check the risk category. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>Dry untreated wool or hair are categorised as low risk. However, they are only low risk if they are both securely enclosed in packaging and&nbsp; sent directly to a plant producing derived products for uses outside the feed chain or a plant carrying out intermediate operations, under conditions which prevent the spreading of pathogenic agents. &nbsp;</p>

                <p>Wool grease or fatty substances derived therefrom (including lanolin and lanolin alcohol), for use outside the feed chain are categorised as low risk. However, processed products derived from wool grease that no longer require further processing when they arrive in Great Britain (other than mixing, coating, assembling or packaging before placing on the market), and are intended for the manufacture of cosmetic products, are subject to specific categorisation. This will be confirmed when the commodity code spreadsheet for non-EU imports is published in due course. &nbsp;</p>
